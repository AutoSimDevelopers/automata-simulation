#Automata Simulation

The simple art to understand a automata and use.
Automata Simulation is a program that can create and modify automata. In the various views the automaton can be created differently depending on the necessity or requirement of the automaton. The expiration of the automaton is clearly represented thereby that there exist different views and there are several options to run the simulation. Import and export is supported, so any time the automaton can be saved and reloaded later.

###Motivation

There are less good programs to represent in theoretical computer science automata. With this program, we want to especially students and any other person help to better understand automata. For us, the focus is that the processing of the individual steps of the automata are clearly displayed.
